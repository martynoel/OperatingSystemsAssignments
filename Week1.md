# Week 1 Questions

### What are the three main purposes of an operating system?

The three main purposes of an operating system are to 1) allocate hardware resources fairly/efficiently, 2) to create a convenient environment for the development and execution of programs, and 3) to secure the hardware from being abused or damaged.

### Keeping in mind the various definitions of operating system, consider whether the operating system should include applications such as web browsers and mail programs. Argue both that it should and that it should not, and support your answers.

An operating system *should* include apps such as web browsers and mail programs because one definition of an operating system is "everything that a vendor ships." Vendors such as Apple and Microsoft ship their products with built-in Web browsers and mail apps; thus, they can be considered part of an operating system. 

An operating system *should not* include apps such as Web browsers and mail apps because the more conventional definition of an OS is the kernel only.
